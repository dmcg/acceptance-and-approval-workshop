Overview
--------

A half-day, hands-on programming workshop exploring how Specification by Example (aka Acceptance Test Driven Development, BDD) can work with numerical and exploratory programming, when:

 * acceptance is qualitative rather than precise, and/or…
 * the behaviour you want to capture involves a lot of numerical data, and/or…
 * you want to transition the results of exploratory programming to production.


Audience

 * Developers and testers
 * Experienced with Specification by Example / Acceptance Test Driven Development / BDD

Room Requirements
